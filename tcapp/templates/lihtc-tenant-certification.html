                <p>
To certify a household to live in a LIHTC unit, <strong>all</strong> income
and assets for the household must be accounted for and verified with the source.
The first question is thus who of the residents in the unit are counted towards
the household?

<h3>Example â€“ Retirement Benefits as Lump-Sum and Periodic Payments</h3>
<p>
Upon retirement, Eleanor Reilly received a lump-sum payment of $15,000. She will also receive periodic pension payments of $350 a month.
</p>
<p>
The lump-sum amount of $15,000 is generally treated as an asset. In this instance, however, Eleanor spent $5,000 of the lump sum on a trip following her retirement. The remaining $10,000 she placed in her mutual fund with other savings. The entire mutual fund will be counted as an asset.
</p>
<p>
The owner has verified that Eleanor is now not able to withdraw the balance from her pension. Therefore, the owner will count the $350 monthly pension payment as annual income and will not list the pension account as an asset.
